        # This is a heuristical (doesn't need any other file than the ecc file) 2-pass algorithm: the first pass tries to find the markers positions, and then the second pass simply reads the original ecc file and copies it while repairing the found markers.
        # The first pass is obviously the most interesting, here's a description: we use a kind of greedy algorithm but with backtracking, meaning that we simply read through all the strings sequentially and just compare with the markers and compute the Hamming distance: if the Hamming distance gets below the threshold, we trigger the found marker flag. Then if the Hamming distance decreases, we save this marker position and disable the found marker flag. However, there can be false positives like this (eg, the marker is corrupted in the middle), so we have a backtracking mechanism: if a later string is found to have a Hamming distance that is below the threshold, then we check if the just previously found marker is in the range (ie, the new marker's position is smaller than the previous marker's length) and if the Hamming distance is smaller, then we replace the previous marker with the new marker's position, because the previous one was most likely a false positive.
        # This method doesn't require any other file than the ecc file, but it may not work on ecc markers that are too much tampered, and if the detection threshold is too low or the markers are too small, there may be lots of false positives.

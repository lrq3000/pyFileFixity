# Makefile like config file for py-make
# To use: `pip install py-make`
# then calle `pymake <command>`
# IMPORTANT: to be compatible with `python setup.py make alias`, you must make
# sure that you only put one command per line, and ALWAYS put a line return
# after an alias and before a command, eg:
#
#```
#all:
#	test
#	install
#test:
#	nosetest
#install:
#	python setup.py install
#    ```
# CRITICAL NOTE: if you get a "FileNotFoundError" exception when trying to call @+python or @+make, then it is because you used spaces instead of a hard TABÂ character to indent! TODO: bugfix this. It happens only for @+ commands and for those after the first command (if the @+ command with spaces as indentation is the first and only statement in a command, it works!)
